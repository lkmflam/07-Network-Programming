# Simple Lab

You have acquired a packet capture (PCAP) file showing network traffic between a newly infected victim computer and the attacker's listening post (LP). The LP is simply a server that is listening for incoming connections on a certain port.
 Review the “register.pcap” file and find the IP address of the attacker’s LP.

Attacker is 10.55.251.48 and is listening on port 9999
